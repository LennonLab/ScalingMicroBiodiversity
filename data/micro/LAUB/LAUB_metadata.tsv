Project	study_abstract	Soils harbor enormously diverse bacterial populations, and soil bacterial communities can vary greatly in composition across space. However, our understanding of the specific changes in soil bacterial community structure that occur across larger spatial scales is limited because most previous work has focused on either surveying a relatively small number of soils in detail or analyzing a larger number of soils with techniques that provide little detail about the phylogenetic structure of the bacterial communities. Here we used a bar-coded pyrosequencing technique to characterize bacterial communities in 88 soils from across North and South America, obtaining an average of 1,501 sequences per soil. We found that overall bacterial community composition, as measured by pairwise UniFrac distances, was significantly correlated with differences in soil pH (r = 0.79), largely driven by changes in the relative abundances of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes across the range of soil pHs. In addition, soil pH explains a significant portion of the variability associated with observed changes in the phylogenetic structure within each dominant lineage. The overall phylogenetic diversity of the bacterial communities was also correlated with soil pH (R2 = 0.50), with peak diversity in soils with near-neutral pHs. Together, these results suggest that the structure of soil bacterial communities is predictable, to some degree, across larger spatial scales, and the effect of soil pH on bacterial community composition is evident at even relatively coarse levels of taxonomic resolution.

Sample	TITLE	Pyrosequencing-Based Assessment of Soil pH as a Predictor of Soil Bacterial Community Structure at the Continental Scale
Sample	samp_collect_device	A total of 98 soil samples that were distinct with respect to soil and site characteristics were collected from a wide array of ecosystem types in North and South America (see Table 3). Only soils unsaturated for the majority of the year were examined. Soils were collected near the height of the plant growing season at each location. To examine whether seasonal variation was important, an additional set of soil samples was collected 6 months after the initial collection at a subset of sites. At each site, the upper 5 cm of mineral soil was collected from 5-10 locations within a given plot of ≈100 m2 and composited into a single bulk sample. All soil samples were shipped to the University of California, Santa Barbara, within a few days of collection, where they were sieved to 4 mm, homogenized, and archived at -80C.

Approximately 10 g of soil from each site was homogenized in a mortar and pestle with liquid N2, and DNAs were extracted from a 0.5-g subsample by use of a MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit following the manufacturer's instructions, with an additional incubation step at 65C for 10 min followed by 2 min of bead beating to limit DNA shearing. Eluted DNAs were stored at −20C.
