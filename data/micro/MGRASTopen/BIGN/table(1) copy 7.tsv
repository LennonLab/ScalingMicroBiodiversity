Project	project_description	This project explores the faecal microbiota from a total of 42 subjects, analysed by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing.

We selected four groups of 10 patients from the cohort: (i) Urinary tract (UTI) patients treated with ciprofloxacin (CP); (ii) UTI patients treated with nitrofurantoin (NF); (iii) patients without antibiotic treatment (CT), and; (iv) one adult household contact for each patient treated with ciprofloxacin (CTCP). In addition, we included two UTI patients treated with fosfomycin (F). All participants provided three stool samples: (i) at baseline (1); (ii) at completion of antibiotic therapy (2), and; (iii) four weeks  after the second sample (3).
