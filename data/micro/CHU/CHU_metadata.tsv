Project	project_description	The severe environmental stresses of the Arctic may have promoted unique soil bacterial communities compared to those found in lower latitude environments. Here, we present the most comprehensive analysis of the biogeography of soil bacterial communities in the Arctic using a high resolution bar-coded pyrosequencing technique. We also compared bacterial communities within arctic soils to soils from a wide range of more temperate biomes to predict variability in soil bacterial communities across the globe. We show that arctic soil bacterial community composition and diversity are structured according to local variation in soil pH rather than geographical proximity to neighboring sites, suggesting that local environmental heterogeneity is far more important than dispersal limitation in determining community-level differences. Furthermore, bacterial community composition varied as much within arctic soils as across soils from a wide range of lower latitude biomes, and diversity levels were also similar, indicating global similarities in the structure of soil bacterial communities. These results contrast with the well-established latitudinal gradients in animal and plant diversity, suggesting that the controls on bacterial community distributions are fundamentally different from those observed for macro-organisms and that our biome definitions are not useful for predicting variability in soil bacterial communities across the globe.
